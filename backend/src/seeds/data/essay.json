      "model_answer": "Protecting the Environment: A Joint Responsibility\n\nPollution is one of the most significant challenges of the 21st century. However, I believe that if we take immediate action, these problems can be solved.\n\nParticularly in large cities, traffic is a major cause of pollution. If governments invested more in efficient electric buses, fewer people would feel the need to drive their private cars (2nd Conditional). In addition, we should have our car engines checked (Causative) regularly to ensure they are not emitting excessive fumes.\n\nNot only does pollution affect the air, but it also damages our water sources. Approximately 8 million tons of plastic end up in the oceans every year. If we had banned single-use plastics twenty years ago, our oceans would be much cleaner today (3rd Conditional/Mixed). Therefore, strict laws are necessary to prevent factories from dumping waste into rivers.\n\nFinally, education is key. Schools should have students participate (Causative) in local clean-up projects.\n\nIn conclusion, although the damage is severe, it is reversible. By improving transport and protecting our waters, we can make a difference."
