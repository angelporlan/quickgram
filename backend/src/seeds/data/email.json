It feels like ages since we last saw each other!\n\nAs for what I'd like to do, I'm really keen on sightseeing. I've heard your city has a beautiful old castle, so I'd love to visit that if possible. Also, I wouldn't say no to a bit of shopping if we have time! I'm easy-going, though, so I'm happy to do whatever you suggest.\n\nRegarding food, I'm not a fussy eater at all. I love trying new things, especially spicy food. The only thing I can't stand is seafood, so please don't take me to a sushi restaurant!\n\nIt would be wonderful if you could pick me up at the airport. My flight lands at 10:30 am, but I can take a bus if you are working or busy.\n\nI can't wait to see you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\n\n[User Name]"
